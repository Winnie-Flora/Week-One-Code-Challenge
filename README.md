- I also provided the return values for every speed range, dpending on an individual driver.
- Strict equality operators played a vital role as the speed measurements and demerit points are specific.

#Net Salary Calculator
-In the net salary program I declared the basic salary and benefits variable.
- I then applied the order of operations to find the gross salary.
- Created a function to compute the NSSF.
- I used the if and else if statements to find the values of NHIF.
- After finding the value of NHIF and NSSF, I applied the order of operations to find the taxable income by deducting the two from the gross salary.
- Created a function and applied the if and else if statement to calculate the payee using the taxable income I obtained in the step above.
- To compute the net salary, I applied the assignment operators, taking gross salary and deducting the sum of taxable income, NHIF, and NSSF.
